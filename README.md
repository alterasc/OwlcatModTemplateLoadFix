# Owlcat Mod Template Load Fix

Fixes error when loading mods that use Owlcat Mod Template (Homebrew Archetypes, Great Radiance, Camelia Romance Expanded, etc )

This mod can break completely as soon as Owlcat changes something, so if you have any problems, remove it immediately when troubleshooting.   

Remove this mod after every patch to check if it's needed. It has a flimsy safeguard to try to deactivate itself if Owlcat changes things, but it's far from reliable.

Install as any other UMM mod.

Thanks to Kurufinve on instructions what to fix.
